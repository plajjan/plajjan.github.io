* Kristian Larsson

I'm a network kind of guy doing network kind of things.

Currently working for Deutsche Telekom / TeraStream with network architecture and automation thereof.

I am the primary author of [[https://github.com/SpriteLink/NIPAP][NIPAP]], a fast, flexible and powerful IPAM with native support for VRFs and IPv6.

[[https://github.com/plajjan/vrnetlab][vrnetlab]] is a system I put together to run virtual routers using docker containers for convenient lab / CI.

When I'm not coding for work I like building on home automation stuff. I wrote a serial binding for OpenHAB to talk to my Benq projector.

Go see my [[https://github.com/plajjan/][github]] page for more up to date info on what I might be working on.
